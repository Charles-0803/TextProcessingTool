# Text Processing and Data Management Tool

---

## Overview

This project is a **Java-based application** that combines the power of **Regular Expressions (Regex)** with efficient data management using **Java Collections**. It provides a user-friendly interface developed with **JavaFX**, enabling users to perform various operations on text data and collections.

---

## Project Objectives

1. **Regular Expressions (Regex):**
    - Gain proficiency in constructing and using regex patterns for searching, matching, and replacing text.

2. **Java Collections:**
    - Learn the fundamentals of `ArrayList`, `Set`, and `Map`, and how to utilize them for managing data.

3. **User Interface Development:**
    - Develop skills in creating interactive GUIs using JavaFX.

4. **Advanced Programming Concepts:**
    - Apply advanced techniques such as object-oriented programming, design patterns, and error handling.

## Features

### Regex Module
- Search for patterns in text using **Regex**.
- Replace text using regex patterns.
- Support for:
    - **Sets, Ranges, Alternations, Shorthands, and Quantifiers**.
- Display match results and replaced text.

### Text Processing Module
- Use Java's `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes to handle regex operations.
- Perform text search and replacement with ease.
- Display operation results in a dedicated output area.

### Data Management Module
- Manage collections of data using Java's `ArrayList`, `Set`, and `Map`.
- Add, update, and delete entries dynamically.
- Ensure proper collection operations with overridden `hashCode` and `equals` methods.
- View and interact with data entries in a **ListView**.

### User Interface
- A clean, interactive GUI built with **JavaFX**.
- Input fields for regex patterns, text data, and collection entries.
- Buttons for executing operations (e.g., Match, Replace, Add, Update, Delete).
- Selection and manipulation of data entries directly from the ListView.
